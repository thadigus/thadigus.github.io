As a systems administrator I am constantly trying to learn more about secure infrastructure and operations. After my degree in Cybersecurity I've aquired support skills and moved into systems administration. I have a passion for ethical hacking and I enjoy the process of creating scalable security automation solutions. While I was in college I founded the Trine University Hacking Team with [another student](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-gaby-mba-a64439194/). A lot of my time was spent on the board of our Computer Science Society, a group for CS students to come together and learn skills beyond the classroom. Along with my studies I was managing a server stack for professors to enhance student learning with hands on labs, teaching a study group for advanced senior-level hacking classes, and having a lot of fun.

With my first internship at [Weigand Construction](https://www.weigandconstruction.com/) I led the roll out and administration of an MDM to over 160 users and over 400 devices. I also covered level 1 helpdesk operations while I was on shift. As the school year rolled in, I continued my work at Weigand Construction with plans to hire on in the Spring. However, Parkview Health reached out to my professors and I was recommended for a Red Hat administration position to fill a newfound gap in on the healthcare team.

After discussing my goals with the team at Weigand we had agreed that it would be best to explore a systems role next. I started at Parkview Health as a Unix/Epic Systems Administrator soon after. With this position I was working on scalable security automations to ensure that, while the servers grow, the team does not. I provided solutions using Ansible and my expertise in Linux to maintain the structure and reliability of our patch management solution so that patching policies are followed even when humans are not involved. Products such as Red Hat Satellite and Ansible Automation Platform provide my team with the ability to scale their efforts and reduce human error.

Weigand Construction and I have grown over the past few years. In the summer of 2025, I have returned as an IT Systems Administrator in an attempt to back fill the role for which my mentor was promoted above. Now I am specializing in business critical solutions in Azure. From managing endpoints at scale with Intune to securing the organization and administering an XDR suite; I am now wearing many hats in my current role. Many of my personal projects focus on Infrastructure as Code solutions that this environment taught me in the past. We will still continue to push forward and create the most technologically advanced construction company for the future.

  Upon graduation and being named the Outstanding CSIT Student of 2022 I was invited to participate on the board of professionals that assist and advise the Trine University Computer Science Department. We work to ensure that the department is consistently up to date with its curriculum. While this is an investment in my own degree I also see it as an investment in future students and a way that I can foster the growth of IT and Cybersecurity students for the Greater Fort Wayne area.

## Hobbies

Outside of IT I work on my 1978 Ford Ranchero Squire and I enjoy getting away from my desk by fishing. It refreshes my mind to spend time outdoors, spending time with friends and family, as well as using my time to learn about other important aspects of life such as financial planning.

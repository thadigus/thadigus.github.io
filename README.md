# thadigus.github.io

This is a simple GitHub project to make sure that I have a traditional GitHub Pages site associated with my username. Quite simply, this site is meant to redirect you to my actual portfolio website located at <https://thadturner.com/>. For the forseeable future this repo will hold nothing more.

My preferred Git platform is GitLab, and most of my projects can be found there. My GitHub account only exists to contribute to projects that are on this platform. Please checkout my GitLab profile at <https://gitlab.com/thadigus/>

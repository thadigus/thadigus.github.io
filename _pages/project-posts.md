In the home lab and beyond I am always working on projects to either learn new technologies or donate my time to the organizations I can assist. Hopefully I can document these projects in a way that will help others do the same. Infrastructure as Code and Linux are my primary interests but I will document anything from radio, to development, to woodworking.

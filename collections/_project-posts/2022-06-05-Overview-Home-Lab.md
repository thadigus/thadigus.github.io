## Hardware

My hardware sits in a 48U server rack that was rescued in my second year of college from a new home owner who did not know what it was. They were happy to have it removed from their basement --- my parents were less than thrilled to have it in their basement.

Because of my distance from my server rack I've relied on sound network architecture and heavy VPN use to perform 100% remote administration of my stack. One crucial design choice was to put the rack network below the NAT of my parent's home gateway. To touch anything on the rack it takes minimum of a one hour drive and because of this I had to make sure that my rack would never cause an internet outage for my family.
